# LMSNextGen
LMSNextGen is an LMS system integrated with AI features. This repository follows the structured approach outlined by **DEHA Company** and encompasses three key functionalities:

1. **Recommendation System:**
   - Feature dedicated to providing personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.
2. **Auto-Generated and Auto-Graded Assignments:**
   - Streamlined functionality allowing automatic generation and grading of assignments using uploaded documentation.
3. **Grammar Error Correction and Grading English Writing Tasks:**
   - Incorporates capabilities for identifying and correcting grammar errors, along with grading English writing tasks based on the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) level.

This project aims to offer a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) with a focus on user-friendly features and efficient task management.

# Technology Stack

1. Backend and Frontend: **Moodle**
   - Moodle serves as the backend and frontend for the LMS, handling course management, user authentication, and providing an intuitive interface for users.
   
2. API Design and Integration: **Flask**
   - Flask is used to design and implement APIs for integrating AI features into the LMS. These APIs facilitate communication between the AI modules and the Moodle system, allowing seamless integration of recommendation systems, assignment generation, and grammar error correction functionalities.

3. AI Mretrained Models:
   - **T5 Transformer**: Utilized for natural language processing tasks such as text generation and grammar error correction.
   - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Used for tasks such as text classification and language understanding.

# Installatioin

## Install Moodle

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-6CWZIH3tAfjefyjPojpbRn2zMGBLLKlyr0pNBjxgoY/edit?fbclid=IwAR3qhrwKdev-F_k2IrBirUCMVWfyNd0OuHjH4xyeFK3cbJIDaehIUGUdClU)(in vietnamese).

1. Access [Moodle](https://download.moodle.org/releases/supported/) and download version 4.1.6.

**Database requiements:**
- MariaDB>=10.6.7
- MySQL>=8.0
- Postgres==13
- Oracle=19c

2. After extract the downdload file, Run the file `Start Moodle.exe` in your folder.
3. Run XAMPP in the directory `server/xampp-control.exe`. You might get some error in when running Moodle. However, don't worry just follows the instruction of Moodle and Fix these error

## Moodle Error

## Implement AI Features

1. Replace `sever/moodle` folder in Moold with this [folder](https://github.com/ThanhHung2112/LMS_AI/tree/main/Moodle_backend/server/moodle), note that you have to make sure that the folder name is `moodle` after replacing.

2. Open Shell

Run `xampp-control.exe` and open `Shell` in XAMPP GUI. Other terminal won work in this situation.

3. To upgrade your database. Run the following commands.

```bash
cd sever/moodle
php admin/cli/upgrade.php    
```
4. Down load this [database.sql](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MoqW56mVGOzqqDBIvO5lxoO4TcpMcRAy/view?usp=sharing)

Run the SQL file in the Moodle database that you have initialized during the initial setup.

For the convenience of demonstrating AI features, the developers have decided to create additional tables with the prefix "mdl_demo". Note: These tables have not been designed in a rigorous manner and may have some degree of redundancy. They are mainly used for quickly demoing AI features.

This is not finish yet. I will continue for soon...
